                            An overworked workforce, undervalued teams, a lack of processes and worst of all, injustice. It's even worse for remote workers, and that's not a world I want to live in. That's why I founded Virtual Work World, to give remote workers, rights. 
                            <br><br>
                            I've worked across Customer Success, Recruitment, Marketing and Digital Growth for over 15 years, led global support teams and marketing for award-winning brands and consulted for many companies internationally, so I know how vital it is for businesses to get the best talent and tech as their key pillars of strength. I have built and managed teams in Brazil, El Salvador, India, the Philippines, Jamaica, Trinidad & Tobago, Mexico, the US, the UK, and Canada. With my 14 yearsâ€™ experience in scaling global teams, I not only find your talent, but match you with the best candidate to suit your business needs and budget.

                            Nothing makes me happier than helping others achieve their career dreams (that, and time spent with my three quirky children).

                                    I've been in the HR industry for over 6 years, working with different organizations across various industries. My passion lies in helping people find their dream jobs, and that's what led me to specialize in talent acquisition and management.
                                    I absolutely love the virtual work world because it offers endless opportunities for professionals to connect and collaborate, no matter where they are in the world. As someone who's worked remotely for a significant part of my career, I understand the unique challenges and benefits that come with virtual work. That's why I'm always looking for ways to create a supportive and engaging virtual work environment for all employees.
                                    And here's a fun fact about me - I'm a big fan of trivia nights! I love gathering with friends and colleagues and testing our knowledge on random topics. So, if you ever need a teammate for a trivia game, you know who to call!
